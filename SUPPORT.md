# Support

## Scope

Support is best-effort and provided by a solo maintainer. This repository is an
open-source local control/workflow bridge for Ableton Live, not a managed
service with guaranteed response times.

## Where To Ask for Help

- Use GitHub Issues for bug reports and reproducible workflow problems.
- Use GitHub Issues for feature requests (describe user outcome first).
- For security concerns, follow `SECURITY.md`.

## What to Include in a Bug Report

- Operating system and version
- Ableton Live version and whether Max for Live is available
- Python version (`python3 --version`)
- Exact command run
- Full error output
- Whether `LiveUdpBridge.amxd` is loaded and reloaded in Live
- Anything already tried

Reports missing this information may be closed until repro details are added.
