# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are applied on a best-effort basis to the latest code on `main`.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open a public issue with exploitable details.

Preferred path:

- Use GitHub private vulnerability reporting:
  `https://github.com/sunflower-of-parchman/codex-live-bridge/security/advisories/new`

If private reporting is unavailable in your interface, open an issue with a
minimal description and request a private follow-up channel.

## What to Include

- Affected file(s) and component(s)
- Reproduction steps
- Impact assessment
- Any suggested mitigation

I will acknowledge good-faith reports as quickly as possible, triage severity,
and publish remediation notes when a fix is available.
