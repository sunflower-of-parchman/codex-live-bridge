# User Preference Templates

These files are intentionally blank templates for user-owned composition context.

Use them as starter docs for your own preferences and workflow.

Suggested setup:

```bash
mkdir -p memory
rsync -a templates/user-preferences/memory/ memory/
```

Then fill the docs with your own preferences.
